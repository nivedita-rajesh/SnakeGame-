# Snake Game

## OBJECTIVE
To implement the classic snake game using turtlesim simulator. 

## INTRODUCTION
The game makes use of turtlesim and turtlesim_teleop packages  to move a snake turtle,  in order to capture the target . Upon capturing the target turtle, a new turtle appears, which will be the new target turtle, and the previously captured turtle becomes part of the snake turtle. The process repeats with the capture of every turtle. 

## PREREQUISITES
1) UBUNTU 18.04
2) ROS MELODIC

## WORKFLOW
1) Create a catkin_workspace.
2) Inside catkin workspace, create a new package named ‘project’.
3) Inside the source folder ‘project’, create a new python file named ‘snake_turtle’.
4) Create a launch file in the package.
5) Open a terminal and source it.
6) Launch the launch file.
